#Hardware Management Multiplexer - Client
hmm.py is a resource management system that allows users to quickly and easily allocate development resources. By mantaining a record of what machines and resources are being used, a user can query and request resources to fit the needs of what they are working on.

This repository holds the client for Hmm, which allows users to interface with the Hmm server.
